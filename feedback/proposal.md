I would challenge you to perhaps try to expand your feature set a bit to perhaps avoid basically being Grumblr with a different face. In order to do so, think about how you could incorporate some other interactions, or for example, make use of APIs like Google Calendar. You have three people, so you want to make sure you project is large enough that you can all demonstrate your knowledge of course concepts. I like that you plan on unit testing. :)

### Shuai

Your proposal of technologies are solid and deployment with MySQL and AWS is really good. However, for the key features you proposed, the workload is clearly too small for a team of three. You should brainstorm more features that can demonstrate more complex model interactions. For example, you can compare two user's schedule and output some common free time slot, which can be useful if multiple users have a team project and need meeting times.

### Brian

I reccommend fullcalendar.io since it integrates well with jquery.  Also moment.js is your friend for communicating dates between javascript and the back-end.  Messaging and matching users to groups should keep the back-end interactions interesting.  Looks good.
